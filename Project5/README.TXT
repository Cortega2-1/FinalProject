One paragraph description:
My project is a program that keeps inventory of a shoe store. It will keep track of size, brand, color, and price of the shoe. The brand, size, color, and price can range from anything it does not need to be specific. It will read a file of the inventory about each shoe, create an object. I will create a test file for input inventory and it will output the information entered. It will also check if a shoe is equal to my shoe size, 11, it will return true it its equal or false if its not equal to my size.

Instructions:
First thing and only input you the user will have to do is enter an input file. When entering an input make sure you enter exactly the way it is named or it will give an error message of ""File not found. Fix spelling errors. Make sure file is created." To compile the program if you want to add a shoe object for a test you need to create a new shoe object with the 4 required parameters of String brand, String color, double size, double price. After that you can check if it is equal to my shoe size by calling the equalSize method for the specific shoe object. You can also call a specific part of the shoe information by calling either the getBrand, getColor, getPrice, or getSize methods. Finally you can set a piece of the shoe information one by one by calling the setPrice, setBrand, setColor, or setSize methods.
